Frankenstein project

The goal of the app is not strictly set.

Nowadays I think of a task scheduling app. Which primary goal is to set tasks you have to done somewhen in the future.
You set date of your completion and you will be notified via email. Also you can pin comments on the task and make your own lifecycles.
In the process you could pin documentation, UML diagrams, pictures or repositories to your task.

This is the current vision of this project.

Backend: Spring

Frontend: Angular

Angular is communicating with backend via REST endpoints.
